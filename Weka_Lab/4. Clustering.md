# WEEK â€“ 4: demonstrate performing clustering on data sets Clustering Tab


#### [1. Load each dataset into Weka and run a simple k-means clustering algorithm with different values of k(number of desired clusters). Study the clusters formed. Observe the sum of squared errors and centroids, and derive insights.](#section-1)

#### [2. Explore the visualization features of Weka to visualize the clusters. Derive interesting insights and explain.](#section-2)

#### [3. Repeat the above studies for Hierarchical and EM clustering methods.](#section-3)

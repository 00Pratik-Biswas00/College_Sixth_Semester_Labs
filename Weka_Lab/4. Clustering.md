# WEEK â€“ 4: demonstrate performing clustering on data sets Clustering Tab


#### [1. Load each dataset into Weka and run a simple k-means clustering algorithm with different values of k(number of desired clusters). Study the clusters formed. Observe the sum of squared errors and centroids, and derive insights.](#section-1)

#### [2. Explore the visualization features of Weka to visualize the clusters. Derive interesting insights and explain.](#section-2)

#### [3. Repeat the above studies for Hierarchical and EM clustering methods.](#section-3)

#### Interpret the Visualization:

Analyze the visualization to derive insights about the structure of the Iris dataset.

Evaluate how well the clusters correspond to the known classes of iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

Identify any overlapping or misclassified instances that may indicate limitations of the clustering approach.

## 3. Repeat the above studies for Hierarchical and EM clustering methods.<a name="section-3"></a>

#### Hierarchical Clustering:

1. Classify different filters in Weka for preprocessing of data: -------------------------

Weka provides various filters for preprocessing data, and they can be broadly classified into the following categories:

Adding and Removing Attributes:

Add
AddID
Remove
RemoveUseless
InterquartileRange
AddCluster
AddExpression

Changing Values:

Normalize
Center
Standardize
SwapValues
MergeTwoValues
ReplaceMissingValues
NumericCleaner
AddValues

Conversions:

Discretize
MakeIndicator
NominalToBinary
NumericToBinary

2. Description of functionalities and parameters for selected filters: -------------------------

Adding and Removing Attributes:

Add: Adds a new attribute to the dataset.
AddID: Adds a unique identifier attribute to instances.
Remove: Removes attributes based on indices or names.
RemoveUseless: Removes attributes that do not contribute to the class prediction.
InterquartileRange: Filters instances based on the interquartile range.
AddCluster: Adds a cluster assignment attribute.
AddExpression: Adds a new attribute based on a mathematical expression.

Changing Values:

Normalize: Scales numeric values to a specific range (default is [0, 1]).
Center: Centers numeric values by subtracting the mean.
Standardize: Standardizes numeric values by scaling them to have zero mean and unit variance.
SwapValues: Swaps two specified values in nominal attributes.
MergeTwoValues: Merges two specified values in nominal attributes.
ReplaceMissingValues: Replaces missing values with a specified value or strategy.
NumericCleaner: Cleans up noisy numeric values.
AddValues: Adds a constant value to numeric attributes.

Conversions:

Discretize: Converts numeric attributes into nominal ones by creating intervals (bins).
MakeIndicator: Converts nominal attributes into binary attributes.
NominalToBinary: Converts nominal attributes into binary ones.
NumericToBinary: Converts numeric attributes into binary ones.

3. Overview of Apriori association rule mining algorithm and metrics: -------------------------

Apriori is a popular algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules. It works by identifying sets of items that frequently occur together in a transactional database.

Metrics used in association rule mining include:

Support: The proportion of transactions that contain the itemset.
Confidence: The likelihood that a rule is correct.
Lift: The ratio of the observed support to that expected if the items were independent.

4. Weka's Apriori algorithm parameters and application: -------------------------

Weka's Apriori algorithm allows customization through parameters in the object editor menu. Common parameters include:

Delta: Specifies the minimum change in support.
LowerBoundMinSupport: The minimum support for an itemset to be considered.
NumRules: Limits the number of rules generated.
